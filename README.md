# Home Automation and Sensing using Arduino and NodeMCU

This repository contains an Arduino C code for an home automation system that enables and ubiquitous control and monitroing of the receptacles using a mobile app over firebase cloud. Also, it collects sensor reading of the ambient condition of the home (light, humidity, temperature and human presense rating) and this can be visualized through the Mobile Application.
